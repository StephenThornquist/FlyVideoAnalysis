% ACTOGRAMANALYSIS  Makes an actogram out of text files and returns Hidden
% Markov Model parameters describing each individual fly's sleep patterns.
%
%    [RAWDATA, SUMMARYSTATS, FLYHMMS] = ACTOGRAMANALYSIS opens a GUI where
%    you select your .txt files and returns the raw numerical activity data
%    as RAWDATA and the data summary statistics as SUMMARYSTATS. The HMM
%    for each fly is returned as FLYHMMS.
%
%    [RAWDATA, SUMMARYSTATS, FLYHMMS] = ACTOGRAMANALYSIS('actogram') opens
%    a GUI where you select your .txt files and returns the raw numerical
%    activity data as RAWDATA and the data summary statistics as
%    SUMMARYSTATS and spits out an actogram.
%
%    [RAWDATA, SUMMARYSTATS, FLYHMMS] =
%    ACTOGRAMANALYSIS('PATH1','PATH2,...) opens .txt files at PATH1, PATH2,
%    etc. and returns the raw numerical actogram data as RAWDATA and the
%    data summary statistics as SUMMARYSTATS. If the first argument is
%    'actogram' (case-insensitive), it will also spit out actograms.
%
%    This is a program which takes in .txt files from the activity monitors
%    this lab seems to love so much, does some data processing, and creates
%    actograms from them. The format is fairly consistent across the
%    actograms, so if the script doesn't work, make sure there haven't been
%    any major changes.
%
%    If the argument field is left blank, this will bring you to the GUI so
%    you can click the file(s) you want. Otherwise, type the path of the
%    files you want to analyze here.

% First check to see if the varargin field is blank

if(nargin == 0)

    if(ischar(filenames))
        dataIn = importdata([pathnames,filenames]);
    else
        for j = 1:length(filenames)
            dataIn(j) = importdata([pathnames,filenames{j}]);
        end
    end
    
    % If it isn't, import the data specified on the command line
elseif(strcmpi(varargin{1},'actogram'))
    actogram = 1;
    if(nargin == 1)
        [filenames,pathnames] = uigetfile('*.txt', 'Multiselect','on');
        if(ischar(filenames))
            dataIn = importdata([pathnames,filenames]);

                dataIn(j) = importdata([pathnames,filenames{j}]);
            end
        end
    end
    for j = 2:nargin

    end
else
    for j = 1:nargin

    end
end

% Note that, for the actograms readout I was given, the format is as
% follows:

% filename \t date numbins duration of bin (minutes) time of start Bin #1
% Bin #2 etc.

% First we extract all the metadata
years = [];
years = [years, dataIn(:).data];
txtdata = [];
txtdata = [txtdata,dataIn(:).textdata];
dates = [txtdata(1,2:3:end); txtdata(1,3:3:end)];

% Now we turn the numerical data into something we can actually use.

numBins = str2double(txtdata(2,1:3:end));
durs = str2double(txtdata(3,1:3:end));
% Note: startTimesCells is still a bunch of cells with strings
startTimesCells = txtdata(4,1:3:end);
% here are the beam crossings:
rawData = str2double(txtdata(5:end,1:3:end));
clear txtdata
%% Analyze data

% With the metadata out of the way, we can start actually looking at the
% ticks in a more interesting way than the actogram alone presents. Let's
% start with an HMM for sleep in which there are two states: a "deep" stage
% and a "shallow" or "restless" stage. We do this for each fly separately.
%
% excluding transitions back to itself:
%
%    Deep  <---->  Fitful  <----> Awake
%
% We have to separate on a fly-by-fly basis because they all will have a
% different total number of sleep bins.
%
% Note: in this section of the code, tasks are written mostly for clarity
% and not so much for speed. If this turns out to be a bit of a beast, I'll
% speed it up later. (07/26/14)

    boutBins{j} = candSleep(find(candSleep(1+boutDuration:end)-...
