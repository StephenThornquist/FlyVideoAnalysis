%
%    [RAWDATA, SUMMARYSTATS, FLYHMMS] = ACTOGRAMANALYSIS('actogram') opens
%    a GUI where you select your .txt files and returns the raw numerical
%    activity data as RAWDATA and the data summary statistics as
%    SUMMARYSTATS and spits out an actogram.
%
%    [RAWDATA, SUMMARYSTATS, FLYHMMS] =
%    ACTOGRAMANALYSIS('PATH1','PATH2,...) opens .txt files at PATH1, PATH2,
%    etc. and returns the raw numerical actogram data as RAWDATA and the
%    data summary statistics as SUMMARYSTATS. If the first argument is
%    'actogram' (case-insensitive), it will also spit out actograms.
%
%    This is a program which takes in .txt files from the activity monitors
%    this lab seems to love so much, does some data processing, and creates
%    actograms from them. The format is fairly consistent across the
%    actograms, so if the script doesn't work, make sure there haven't been
%    any major changes.
%
%    If the argument field is left blank, this will bring you to the GUI so
%    you can click the file(s) you want. Otherwise, type the path of the
%    files you want to analyze here.

%% Importing the data

% Default setting: no actograms.
actogram = 0;

% First check to see if the vargin field is blank

if(nargin == 0)
    [filenames,pathnames] = uigetfile('*.txt', 'Multiselect','on');
    if(ischar(filenames))
        dataIn = importdata([pathnames,filenames]);
    else    
        for j = 1:length(filenames)
            dataIn(j) = importdata([pathnames,filenames{j}]);
        end
    end

% If it isn't, import the data specified on the command line
elseif(strcmpi(vargin{1},'actogram'))
    actogram = 1;
    for j = 2:nargin
        dataIn(j-1) = importdata(vargin(j));
    end
else
    for j = 1:nargin
        dataIn(j) = importdata(vargin(j));
    end
end

% Note that, for the actograms readout I was given, the format is as
% follows:

% filename \t date numbins duration of bin (minutes) time of start Bin #1
% Bin #2 etc.

% First we extract all the metadata
years = [];
years = [years, dataIn(:).data];
txtdata = [];
txtdata = [txtdata,dataIn(:).textdata];
dates = [txtdata(1,2:3:end); txtdata(1,3:3:end)];

% Now we turn the numerical data into something we can actually use.

numBins = str2double(txtdata(2,1:3:end));
durs = str2double(txtdata(3,1:3:end));
% Note: startTimesCells is still a bunch of cells with strings
startTimesCells = txtdata(4,1:3:end);
% here are the beam crossings:
rawData = str2double(txtdata(5:end,1:3:end));
clear txtdata
%% Analyze data

% With the metadata out of the way, we can start actually looking at the
% ticks in a more interesting way than the actogram alone presents. Let's
% start with an HMM for sleep in which there are two states: a "deep" stage
% and a "shallow" or "restless" stage. We do this for each fly separately.
%
% excluding transitions back to itself:
%   
%    Deep  <---->  Shallow <----> Awake
%
% We have to separate on a fly-by-fly basis because they all will have a
% different total number of sleep bins.
%
% Note: in this section of the code, tasks are written mostly for clarity
% and not so much for speed. If this turns out to be a bit of a beast, I'll
% speed it up later. (07/26/14)
